# portfolio

The assignment was to create a personal portfolio based on a given design. The page should also meet the accessibility-requirements

I felt it was a very time consuming job because it has a lot of components and details and I have still not enough experience with CSS to feel comfortable with it. Every step still requires thought, trial and error. 

Therefor I told myself this was to be a work in progress, focused on the basics of the assignment and to make the page fit the requirements. The personal design have to come later. I have validated my code and tested in the different browsers but I am aware of that there is still much I can improve to make the page more accessible.
